Where there may be reason to suspect that the accused has been persuaded or coerced to make a confession, even longer period may have to be given to him before his statement is recorded. In our opinion, in the circumstances of this case it is impossible to accept the view that enough time was given to the accused to think over the matter. Indeed, any Magistrate with enough criminal experience would have immediately decided to give longer time to Sarwan Singh in the present case for the obvious reason that Sarwan Singh appeared to the learned Magistrate to be keen on making a confession straightaway. The learned Magistrate himself has fairly stated that he would have given him longer time but for his insistence to make a confession without delay. This insistence on the part of Sarwan Singh to make a confession immediately should have put the learned Magistrate on his guard because it obviously bore traces of police pressure or inducement. Unfortunately, the effect of the failure of the learned Magistrate to grant enough time to the accused to consider the matter has not been considered by the learned Sessions Judge and has been wholly ignored by the learned Judges of the High Court. Besides, in neither court below has any attention been paid to the fact that Sarwan Singh appeared to have been kept in police custody without any justification between November 26 and November 30. We have carefully considered all the relevant facts bearing on this question and we see no escape from the conclusion that the failure of the learned Judges of the High Court to take into account these material facts has introduced a serious legal infirmity in their conclusion that the confession made by Sarwan Singh is voluntary. That is why we think we must reverse this conclusion." (emphasis supplied)
Delayed Confession (to facilitate tutoring)? 222. According to the prosecution, the accused was arrested on 29.12.2006 and on that day itself he made a detailed confession to the police. The accused also allegedly made a confessional statement at the crime scene leading to the recovery of bones, clothes belonging to other victims. According to prosecution, the accused was sent for narco analysis test etc. on 3.1.2006 and he again made a detailed confessional statement. Accused is said to have made further confessional statement on 11.1.2007, 13.1.2007 and 18.1.2007. Not much progress is shown to have been made in the investigation after 18.1.2007. Surprisingly the accused, however, was not produced before the magistrate for recording of his confession though repeated confessional statements are alleged to have been made by the accused before the police. None of these confessional statements adhere to the safeguards contemplated in law for ascertaining the voluntariness of accused SK. It is almost after  two months of uninterrupted police custody that the accused has been produced before the magistrate for recording his confession. 223. The prosecution has not placed on record any credible material to demonstrate the progress of investigation for over a month and a half after 18.1.2007. The applications for remand successively made by the prosecution came up with contradictory versions of the police on the need for further custody of the accused. The remand application made on 8.2.2007 and 22.2.2007 shows that police custody of accused SK was sought by the CBI on the pretext of recovering the body parts and clothes of victims D and 'XYZ' as also its identification. However, this Court in the judgment rendered in the case of 'XYZ' has clearly noticed that skulls and clothes of victim had been recovered and identified on 29.12.2006 and 3.1.2007 itself. Similar recoveries were also made in respect of victim D before moving of application for remand. It is in this context that we are required to examine the argument of defence that purpose of prolong police custody prior to his confession was to secure; (a) the consent of accused to submit to the prosecution on account of torture; (b) allow time for torture injuries to heal and; (c) allow time to accused to memorise the entire confession tailored to suit the recovery evidence. 224. According to defence the object was to sensationalise the crime with such perverted details that the reader's critical senses are numbed and the sense of revulsion, sprung against the accused. Torture to accused
225. In Babu Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 1964 (1) Cr.L.J. 566 the Supreme Court dealt with a case of prolong police custody prior to confession where substantial period of police custody was not explained for the investigation. An inference was drawn by the court by relying upon the incident of unexplained and prolong police custody that the period was utilized to torture the accused and to tutor him extensively about the contents of what he was required to show by way of confession by memorizing the script. 226. Throughout his confession, accused SK repeatedly states he has been tutored by the police on vital aspects of the confession, including the names of the victims, the time, method, manner of killing etc. On 18 separate occasions, he states that he cannot remember. For example, in his confession accused SK states as follows:
"(i) He says that the police made him memorise the names of the victims by showing him photographs. Question: What have they made you memorise? Answer: When the UP police arrested me they made me see these photos again and again and told me the names of these people. For each photograph, they told me the name, the time, the manner, etc. But I don't know about the time even now. They had told me all this but I have forgotten. (ii) He says that whatever names he has given for the victims he was told them by the police while showing him the photographs. Question: When the police showed you the photographs, would you remember that you had killed that person, etc.? Answer: I remembered very little and very faintly and that is what I have told them. (iii) He says he does not remember anyone's name and all the names were told to him by the police." 227. The above-quoted illustrative extracts from the confession supports the inference that the confession was not based on accused SK's personal knowledge but on what he had been tutored to say by the investigative agencies. This also lends credence to the defence version of it being the reason for unusually prolonged police custody prior to the recording of his confession, namely to ensure that he could remember and recite the confession taught to him by the investigative agency. 228. Tutoring by its very nature implies compulsion and falsity and is hit by Section 24 of the Evidence Act. The fact of tutoring is not limited to the names of the victims but also the time, method and manner of the killings etc. Tutoring with regard to even one of these aspects would attract the bar u/s 24 Evidence Act. 229. It is extremely unnatural and defies logic that accused SK has no clear recollection of the nature and manner in which he disposed off the bodies or whether he had sex with them or whether he ate parts of them, but has a clear and categorical recollection of the time, sequence and manner of entrapping his victims. It is also surprising that he does not remember the names of the victims, or the date of each offence but he is able to chronologically narrate the sequence of killings in his confession. This further strengthens the argument that accused SK was tutored by the investigating agency and the same was done to ensure that the confession is in consonance with the prosecution case. 230. In the confession, accused SK states that UP Police ne ratwaya regarding the names, times and manner of killing of the victims. The term 'ratwaya' (made to memorize) implies compulsion, coercion and interference by the police, negates the voluntariness of a confession. It cannot be ascertained what is voluntary and true, and what is tutored and false. When there is evidence of tutoring, it is impossible to identify which part of the confession is tutored and which part is genuine. The taint attaches to the entire document. 231. We have been taken through the confessional statement in great detail by Sri Chaudhary. In his confessional statement also the accused has alleged that he was tortured. Following extract of the confessional statement is on record of the confession itself and is reproduced hereinafter:-
"Jismesein 2-3 photo aisi thi matlab usme se mere ko kaafi torture kiya aur tab ja kar ke matlab jo inhone mere ko kabool karvai thi. Acha! Bohot zyaada torture kiya gaya tha mere ko. Acha! To jiski vajah se unhone mere ko ye do-teen photo jo hai matlab isme se kuch wo karwai thi, jo maine yahaan CBI main aakar mana kar diya ki aap chahe kuch bhi kar lo ye maine kiya hi nahi hai." 232. The above statement categorically mentions in the confession itself that the accused has been severely tortured and coerced to confess. The statement testifies to the coercive manner in which the confession has been extracted from accused SK and signifies the involuntary nature of it. There is otherwise no clarity with regard to which of the photograph that he was tortured. The possibility of accused having been tortured of the photograph of victim is, therefore, borne out on record. 233. The Accused also wrote a detailed letter to the Learned Sessions Judge dt. 25.11.08 and 16.3.09 stating, in detail, the brutal methods employed by the police to secure his confession. Although these letters were written generally to the trial court which was presiding over a large number of trials involving accused SK, and not in any specific case, these letters have been included at pg 88 in the appeal paperbook of CC 4196/2010 and at pg 91 in in the appeal paperbook of CC 4196/2010. Furthermore, two additional letters dated 1.4.10 and 10.6.11 were written by accused SK to the trial court in connection with ST No 740/07 and ST No 494/07 which are included in the paperbook of CC 835/11 at pg 295 and in the paperbook of CC 147/13 at pg 347. In the letter dt. 16.3.09 he specifically states that he was repeatedly beaten by the police. He further mentions that during police custody he was beaten up and made to sign on several blank pages (pg 91 in CC 4196/2010). In his statement in letter dated 10.6.11 in CC 147/13, accused SK specifically requests that he be medically examined as he still bears the scars of the torture meted out to him. Further on 29.3.2010, accused SK wrote a letter (pg 736 in the paperbook) detailing the manner in which the CBI tortured, threatened and coerced him into making the confession. He states that the CBI informed him that his family was in their custody and if he did not confess as per their say, they would leave the family to the mercy of the frenzied mob who were baying for his blood. 234. It has been judicially accepted that it is almost impossible for an accused in custody to prove torture. As long as the proved facts give rise to a reasonable probability that the confession is a product of a threat or inducement it must be disregarded. In his statement u/s 313, while describing the brutal torture inflicted on him and had left marks on his body the accused SK also offered to get himself medically examined to prove the torture. However, neither the learned Sessions Court Judge nor the learned Magistrate who recorded the confession took any steps to have the accused SK medically examined. Confession letter to ACMM, New Delhi
235. It is also pertinent to note that the application of accused for confession is addressed to the learned ACMM, New Delhi and the SJM, CBI, Delhi. Accused SK in his confession categorically admits to having no knowledge of the name of the Court where he has been produced. Had accused SK indeed addressed the application to the ACMM, New Delhi, he would have also known the Court in which he was being produced to record his confession. Additionally, prior to 28.02.2007, accused SK was being produced before the learned SJM Ghaziabad. Hence, it is extremely unnatural that he would on his own address his letter to the ACMM, New Delhi. This further strengthens his claim that he wrote the letter on the CBI's coercion. 236. Furthermore, the letter by itself is in the nature of a confession, wherein he states he wants to confess regarding the manner in which he killed the victims, then had sex and disposed the bodies. This is contrary to the confession itself, wherein he mentions having sex and then killing. This contrary phrasing further strengthens the case that the letter was written on CBI's coercion. 237. Accused SK had worked as a labourer and servant all his life and had barely studied till the seventh standard. He admits to never having been in a Court or having any knowledge of legal proceedings. However, the letter is written as a legal application in formal Hindi, using official vocabulary that can only be known by someone who is familiar with the legal system and routinely writes formal applications to the court. Words such as "Samaksh, prarthi, nivedan, prastut" are not used in colloquial speech but are part of a legal vocabulary which would have been beyond accused SK's knowledge. The language of the letter strongly suggests that the contents were dictated by a police officer. No proper medical examination
238. The learned ACMM had directed that before accused SK is handed over to DG (Prisons) Tihar, he be medically examined. Contrary to the learned ACMM's order, no medical examination of the Accused is done prior to handing him over to Tihar prison authorities. The only medical report furnished is the one done by the Jail Hospital on 1.3.2007. Accused SK was produced for recording his confession on 28.2.07 after 60 days of uninterrupted police custody. It was therefore crucial that a medical examination was conducted on 28.2.07, prior to transferring him to judicial custody to ensure that the request to record a confession was not coerced by the CBI. The CBI's failure to conduct a medical examination, despite the Court's categorical order, is extremely suspicious and gives rise to an adverse inference u/s 114(g) of the Evidence Act. 239. This medical report on 1.3.07 has a noting to the effect that 'No fresh injuries were seen'. This in itself does not rule out the presence of older injuries on accused SK's person and supports his allegation of torture by the police. If older injuries were present on accused SK's body, they should have been noted by the doctor, and their ages and causes ought to have been ascertained. However, due sensitivity on part of the magistrate to this aspect of vital concern is clearly overlooked. 240. In his letter to the Learned Sessions Court, accused SK categorically stated that whenever the CBI took him for medical examination they pressurised the doctor into not mentioning any of the accused's injuries. 241. The medical officer, who is the only person who could have proved the medical report dated 1.3.07, or testified to the nature of accused SK's injuries, has not been examined. Suppression of this crucial testimony leads to an adverse inference u/s 114(g) Evidence Act. Prosecution stand on torture
242. Learned counsel for the CBI, Sri Jitendra Mishra has argued that the reference of torture in confession was only with regard to 2-3 photographs and the allegation of torture otherwise is against the U.P. Police and not the CBI. It is also argued that the attending facts and circumstances are suggestive of the complicity of accused and, therefore, the isolated statement in his confession referring to torture must be confined to 2-3 photographs and would not vitiate the confession. Analysis of evidence on torture
243. The argument of CBI counsel Sri Mishra does not appeal to the Court, inasmuch as, the exact number of photographs for which he was tortured has not been clarified. Once the accused during the course of confession had alleged torture, the magistrate ought to have been alarmed and was expected to have probed about the torture. When was the torture made; how was it made; where it was made; who made it, etc. were obvious questions and were required to be asked from the accused and then probed. The magistrate otherwise should have directed the accused to have been medically examined. Necessary inquiry by the magistrate at the time of recording of confession by the accused has therefore not been made by the magistrate. 244. The argument of CBI that torture of accused by U.P. Police would not create any taint in the confession made by accused during his custody with the CBI is also not acceptable. The accused, herein, was initially in the custody of U.P. Police and was later in the custody of CBI. 245. We find substance in the argument of Sri Chaudhary that mere fact that allegation of torture is against previous investigation agency and, therefore, confession made without specific allegation of torture by subsequent investigating agency (CBI, herein) would not eliminate the confession from the taint of torture and make it voluntary. The argument of CBI, if accepted, would run counter to Section 24 of the Evidence Act. 246. The language of the confession is unclear and does not lead to a clear conclusion about what was induced by torture and what was not. Accused SK keeps mentioning that his memory is faint. Thus, it cannot be stated with any degree of certainty that the torture was only for few photos and not the rest. 247. If there is evidence of torture, how can one say which part is induced by torture and which part is not? When a confession follows torture, it raises the presumption that it was induced by torture. 248. A confession needs to be clear, unequivocal, unambiguous, convincing, consistent with the internal evidence and capable of only one meaning. It should be such that it can be believed blindfolded. The truthfulness and voluntariness must attach to each and every part of the confession. If there is evidence of coercion, it cannot be determined as to which part of the confession is coerced and which part is not? Confession in view of Section 28 of the Act of 1872
249. The Prosecution has relied on S. 28 of the evidence act to argue that accused SK's Section 164 Cr.P.C. confession is admissible as it was made after the removal of the impression caused by torture. The prosecution relies on accused SK's stray statement that he refused to admit to have killed the victims in certain photographs before the CBI. The Appellant submits that S. 28 has no application in the present case. 250. For S. 28 to be applicable the "impression" of threat, promise or inducement needs to be fully removed. The term "impression" is far less fragile than either memory, impact, effect or even consequence. The term "impression" is synonymous or comparable with a vague subconscious feeling. The legislature has deliberately used the term "impression" and held that for a confession to be admissible even the vague subconscious memory of the torture should have been fully removed. Facets of confession in this case
251. We cannot suppress our concern and surprise at the manner in which legal aid for five minutes was provided to the accused and has been found sufficient by the learned ACMM, New Delhi. Giving of five minutes time for legal aid to the accused was not only highly insufficient but virtually amounted to a farce. Legal Aid counsel will require lot more time to even understand the case of accused much less the time required to ascertain as to what was required to be done to secure his interest. Accused was not given any medical assistance. The investigating agency was also called inside the photography room and made to state the allegations against the appellant before the recording of confession. The CBI I.O. was also directed to wait outside the room throughout the period of recording. During the writing of transcript the appellant was handed over to I.O. at the end of everyday for production before the learned ACMM. 252. The confession transcription clearly notes at the end of proceedings on 1.3.2007 that the accused was given to I.O. for his production before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate much after 10.00 pm. The Metropolitan Magistrate, even on 2nd March, 2007, has clearly recorded that a separate order was passed and was given to the I.O. for producing the accused before learned ACMM. These two orders clearly proves that on the night of 1st March, 2007 and again after conclusion of recording of transcript on 2nd March, 2007, the accused was given in the custody of the Investigating Officer of CBI who had initially produced him for recording confession. This direction of the magistrate clearly shows that the I.O. was not only present outside the room throughout the recording of transcript but was given the custody of the accused at the end of the day. The admitted access of I.O. to the custody of accused is a matter of serious concern. This circumstances would clearly lend credence to a reasonable doubt in the minds of the accused and it cannot be said that the accused SK was completely free of influence of the Investigating Agency when his statement was recorded or transcribed. 253. Given the intrinsic nature of torture, it is almost impossible to eradicate the "impression" of brutal police torture that is stamped deep into a person's sub conscious. The gruesome details of the torture given by the appellant in his retraction letters and statement u/s 313, if true, would forever haunt a person. Unfortunately, no effort was made by the Court of Sessions to ascertain its correctness. The manner in which the appellant mechanically parrots the confession including the details that he himself states were tutored and had been coerced to remember 'ratwaya' clearly indicates that he was still reeling under the impression of the torture and tutoring. 254. That even though the appellant lets accidentally slip that he was tortured, it would have been impossible for him to continue to give the full details of the same knowing that the IO was standing outside the room. Further, at this point even the recording magistrate does not give him any assurance that he should be free of fear or ask him further details regarding who tortured him or the manner of the same. Thus, a stray line that the Appellant did not concede to killing the victims in two photographs before the CBI does not substantiate the prosecution's submission that the effect of torture has been fully removed. 255. In Pyare Lal Bhargava vs State of Rajasthan AIR 1963 SC 1094, the Supreme Court has observed as under in para 4 and 5 of the report:-
"4. The first question turns upon interpretation of the provisions of Section 24 of the Evidence Act and its application to the facts found in this case. Section 24 of the Evidence Act lays down that a confession caused by inducement, threat or promise is irrelevant in criminal proceedings under certain circumstances. Under that section a confession would be irrelevant if the following conditions were satisfied : (1) it should appear to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise; (2) the said threat, inducement or promise must have reference to the charge against the accused person; (3) it shall proceed from a person in authority; and (4) the court shall be of the opinion that the said inducement, threat or promise is sufficient to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable in supposing that he would gain an advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him. The crucial word in the first ingredient is the expression "appears". The appropriate meaning of the word "appears" is "seems". It imports a lesser degree of probability than proof. Section 3 of the Evidence Act says:
"A fact is said to be 'proved' when after considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists". Therefore, the test of proof is that there is such a high degree of probability that a prudent man would act on the assumption that the thing is true. But under Section 24 of the Evidence Act such a stringent rule is waived but a lesser degree of assurance is laid down as the criterion. The standard of a prudent man is not completely displaced, but the stringent rule of proof is relaxed. Even so, the laxity of proof permitted does not warrant a court's opinion based on pure surmise. A prima facie opinion based on evidence and circumstances may be adopted as the standard laid down. To put it in other words, on the evidence and the circumstances in a particular case it may appear to the court that there was a threat, inducement or promise, though the said fact is not strictly proved. This deviation from the strict standards of proof has been designedly accepted by the legislature with a view to exclude forced or induced confessions which sometimes are extorted and put in when there is a lack of direct evidence. It is not possible or advisable to lay down an inflexible standard for guidance of courts, for in the ultimate analysis it is the court which is called upon to exclude a confession by holding in the circumstances of a particular case that the confession was not made voluntarily. 5. The threat, inducement or promise must proceed from a person in authority and it is a question of fact in each case whether the person concerned is a man of authority or not. What is more important is that the mere existence of the threat, inducement or promise is not enough, but, in the opinion of the court the said threat, inducement or promise shall be sufficient to cause a reasonable belief in the mind of accused that by confessing he would get an advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding against him : while the opinion is that of the court, the criterion is the reasonable belief of the accused. The section, therefore, makes it clear that it is the duty of the court to place itself in the position of the accused and to from an opinion as to the state of his mind in the circumstances of a case." 256. In Aloke Nath Dutta (supra), the Court has observed as under in para 108:-
"108. The courts while applying the law must give due regard to its past experience. The past experience of the courts as also the decisions rendered by the superior courts should be taken as a wholesome guide. We must remind ourselves that despite the fact that procedural safeguards contained in Section 164 Cr.P.C. may be satisfied, the courts must look for truthfulness and voluntariness thereof. It must, however, be remembered that it may be retracted subsequently. The court must, thus, take adequate precaution. Affirmative indication of external pressure will render the retracted confession nugatory in effect. The court must play a proactive role in unearthing objective evidence forming the backdrop of retraction and later the examination of such evidence of retraction. However, in cases where none exists, the court must give the benefit of doubt to the accused. Where there is no objective material available for verifying the conditions in which the confession was retracted, the spirit of Section 24 of the Evidence Act (irrelevance of confession caused by inducement) may be extended to retracted confession. An inverse presumption must be drawn from absence of materials." (emphasis supplied)
257. Use of word "appears" in Section 24 of the Act of 1872 is intentional with the object of securing absolute fairness in admitting confessions into evidence and discarding it if a reasonable apprehension arises, on facts, of it being caused by inducement, threat or promise. "Appears" has been deliberately used by Parliament, for it is impossible for the accused to prove torture/inducement/ threat since he is alone in police custody. Positive proof of torture is not required and a well-grounded suspicion may also suffice. 258. If the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of a confession appear to cast a doubt on the veracity or voluntariness of the confession, the Court may refuse to act upon the confession even if it is admissible in evidence. In Dagdu v. State of Maharashtra (1977) 3 SCC 68 the Supreme Court held as under in para 51:-
"51. Learned Counsel appearing for the State is right that the failure to comply with Section 164(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, or with the High Court Circulars will not render the confessions inadmissible in evidence. Relevancy and admissibility of evidence have to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act. Section 29 of that Act lays down that if a confession is otherwise relevant it does not become irrelevant merely because, inter alia, the accused was not warned that he was not bound to make it and the evidence of it might be given against him. If, therefore, a confession does not violate any one of the conditions operative under Sections 24 to 28 of the Evidence Act, it will be admissible in evidence. But as in respect of any other admissible evidence, oral or documentary, so in the case of confessional statements which are otherwise admissible, the Court has still to consider whether they can be accepted as true. If the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of a confession appear to cast a doubt on the veracity or voluntariness of the confession, the Court may refuse to act upon the confession even if it is admissible in evidence. That shows how important it is for the Magistrate who records the confession to satisfy himself by appropriate questioning of the confessing accused, that the confession is true and voluntary. A strict and faithful compliance with Section 164 of the Code and with the instructions issued by the High Court affords in a large measure the guarantee that the confession is voluntary. The failure to observe the safeguards prescribed therein are in practice calculated to impair the evidentiary value of the confessional statements." (emphasis supplied)
259. Supreme Court in Mohd Ajmal Amir Kasab v. State of Maharashtra (2012) 9 SCC I has authoritatively pronounced that if a doubt is created regarding the voluntariness of the confession, the confession is to be trashed. In para 457 of the report the Court has observed as under:- 
"....The true test is whether or not the confession is voluntary. If a doubt is created regarding the voluntariness of the confession, notwithstanding the safeguards stipulated in Section 164 it has to be trashed; but if a confession is established as voluntary it must be taken into account, not only constitutionally and legally but also morally." 260. Similarly in Mohd. Jamiludin Nasir v. State of WB (2014) 7 SCC 443 the Court has held that if the court has an iota of doubt, it should reject the confession. 261. Apart from the attending circumstances creating serious doubt upon the voluntariness of confession we find that the confession of accused SK itself mentions that pressure was exerted by the police which clearly goes against the prosecution case. Allegation of torture is made in the confession itself and therefore not much endeavour is required to be made to raise a doubt upon it. 262. Strict proof is otherwise not required and the sufficiency of threat or inducement is to be seen from the perspective of the accused. It is settled that if the accused would have a reasonable belief that by, confessing he would gain an advantage or avoid an evil, it cannot be relied upon. 263. The question whether a particular confession attracts the frown of S.24 has to be decided from the point of view of the confessing accused as to how the inducement threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority would operate on his mind. 264. The CBI moved an application to record the confession of accused SK before the learned ACMM, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi citing prior incidents of violence in the Ghaziabad Court premises during remand proceedings on 25.01.07. However, the CBI deliberately suppressed the fact that accused SK had been produced before the learned CBI Magistrate, Ghaziabad, on two further occasions i.e. on 8.02.2007 and 22.02.2007, without any incident. Therefore, the reason for moving the application at Delhi also remains questionable. 265. It is the CBI's case that accused SK was badly beaten up by the advocates and public when he was produced in the Ghaziabad Court on 25.1.07 and therefore faced an absolute security threat and danger. However, the CBI did not report the assault on accused SK to the Magistrate before whom he was produced on 25.1.07. Further, the CBI did not produce any medical treatment papers corresponding to the said incident nor did they take any steps to provide accused SK with any additional security. Moreover, not only did the CBI not mention the assault on accused SK to the Magistrate on 25.1.07, they did not breathe a word regarding a security threat to Magistrate subsequent to the day of assault. The first mention of this threat is made only before the ACMM, New Delhi, in the IO's application for recording his confession filed on 28.2.07. 266. The failure to mention the grave security threat and a vicious physical assault on accused SK by advocates of the court to the Magistrate is not substantiated and sounds suspicious. 267. If before confessing, accused SK was facing a threat at Ghaziabad jail, as claimed by the CBI, this threat would have increased manifold after his confession. It is therefore inexplicable why, immediately after completion of the confession accused SK was shifted back to Gaziabad Jail and no threat was apprehended. Safeguards of Section 164 Cr.P.C. 268. The law imposes safeguards u/s. 164 Cr.P.C. to ensure that the confession is voluntarily given and free from any compulsion or coercion. The safeguards aim to ensure that the confessor has completely understood the consequences of making a confession and still makes one by exercising his free will. According to the defence the mandatory safeguards under s. 164 were allegedly not complied with in this case, and this non-compliance renders the confession inadmissible, unreliable and unworthy of credit. 269. In Shivappa vs. State of Karnataka (1995) 2 SCC page 76, the Court has clearly observed that non-compliance with the provisions contained under Section 164 Cr.P.C. renders confession unworthy of credit. It is held that procedural requirement of Section 164 must be complied with in letter and spirit. Any failure to comply with the requirement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. impairs the evidentiary value of confession. 270. It is well established that before the Magistrate records an accused's confession he should tell him that he is giving him some time to think over whether or not he wants to confess and for this purpose he is sending the accused to judicial custody where he will be beyond the control of the police. Unless the accused is informed of the purpose of sending him to judicial custody, this salubrious provision will lose its meaning and efficacy. In the present case, accused SK was perfunctorily sent to judicial custody by the learned ACMM who was not the Magistrate who recorded the accused's confession. Moreover, the Learned ACMM did not inform accused SK that he was being sent to judicial custody in order to give him some time to think over whether or not he wants to make the confession and during this period the police will not be allowed to contact him. Consequently, when accused SK was remanded to judicial custody he did not know why he was being sent there. Judicial custody in the absence of any information regarding the purpose behind the same is of no value. 271. In Babu Singh v. State of Punjab 1964 (1) Cri LJ 566 the Supreme Court has emphasized the need to give reasonable time to the accused to deliberate on the need to make a confession. The fact that Magistrate had not recorded in the proceedings about giving of opportunity to think over the issue has also been held to be a circumstance to discard confession. 272. Further, even the Magistrate who recorded accused SK's confession also did not give him an opportunity to think over the matter by remanding him to judicial custody before recording his confession. Nor did he enquire with accused SK whether he had thought over the matter, or whether he wants some more time to think over the matter. Instead, he proceeded to forthwith record accused SK's confession without satisfying himself about grant of opportunity to the accused SK to deliberate over the issue. 273. It is by now well settled that the Magistrate has to inform the accused before sending him to judicial custody for reflection time that he was not bound to give a confession, that he should think it over, that the confession could be used to convict him in a capital case. He must be made to realise the consequences of making a confession which will send him to the gallows. 274. Accused SK was sent to judicial custody for merely 24 hours. Judicial custody of merely 24 hours is grossly insufficient when the accused has been in police custody for 60 days. The duration of reflection time is dependent on the duration of the preceding police custody and the time necessary to neutralize the influence of the police. The accused SK otherwise was not informed that even this 24 hours time is being given to him to ponder over the issue of making confession. No effective legal aid
275. Sri Chaudhary for the appellant submits that the concerned ACMM at New Delhi court merely did the formality of legal aid to the accused.
